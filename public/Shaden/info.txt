Shaden is a brand that we designed for a modest clothing and dresses business. We intended to convey a classic and calm vibe while still maintaining a slight luxurious feel, which we reflected in the colors. The logo is a Naskh style wordmark that spells the word "Shaden" in Arabic, which means "deer." It's one of our proud Arabic brand identities, and we loved to share it with you!
